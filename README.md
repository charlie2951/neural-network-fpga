# Implementing a neural network on an FPGA
This ongoing project aims to implement a neural network on an FPGA. The languages used to achieve this are C and Verilog. Phase 1 of the project aims to implement floating point arithmetic using the IEEE 754 standard. The first goal of this project is to implement a simple ANN and then work our way up to CNNs, etc. This project is part of the B.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering degree at KIIT University.

The decimal_to_binary.c file implements the single precision IEEE 754 standard for any floating point number from -inf to +inf.
